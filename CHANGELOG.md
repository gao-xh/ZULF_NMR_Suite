# Changelog

All notable changes to the ZULF-NMR Suite will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Changed - 2025-10-10
- **Architecture Restructuring**: Modular separation of simulation and data processing
  - Created `src/simulation/` module structure (ui/, core/, backends/, workers/)
  - Created `src/processing/` module structure (ui/, core/, io/, workers/)
  - Migrated data to organized structure:
    - `presets/` → `data/simulation/presets/`
    - `user_save/` → `data/simulation/user_save/`
    - `spectrum/` → `data/simulation/output/spectrum/`
  - Created `data/experimental/` for experimental data processing
- **Documentation Update**: Reflected new structure in README, PROJECT_STATUS, and INDEX
- **Cleanup**: Removed redundant temporary documentation files

### In Progress - 2025-10-10
- Code migration to new data paths with fallback support
- Pure Python simulation backend integration (TwoD_simulation.py)
- Experimental data processing module implementation
- Unified UI with simulation and processing tabs

## Upgrade Notes

### Upgrading to 3.0.0

**New Configuration File**
- Create or update `config.txt` in project root
- Set `PYTHON_ENV_PATH` to your Python interpreter
- Customize other settings as needed

**No Code Changes Required**
- Existing save files compatible
- All functionality preserved
- New features are optional

**Environment Setup**
- Update to path-based environment configuration
- Verify dependencies with `python test_system.py`
- Check configuration with `python test_config.py`

### Upgrading to 2.0.0

**Save File Format**
- Old format automatically detected
- Multi-system data structure
- Backward compatible loading

**UI Changes**
- New multi-system interface
- System tabs for organization
- Weight and broadening controls

## Known Issues

- MATLAB engine first-time startup can take 10-30 seconds
- Large molecular systems may require significant RAM
- File paths with spaces may need quotes in command line

## Future Plans
