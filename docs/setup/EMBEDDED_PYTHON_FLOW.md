EMBEDDED PYTHON - FIRST RUN FLOW SIMPLIFICATION
=================================================================
Generated: 2025-10-10 16:30:10

CONTEXT
=================================================================

The application now includes embedded Python (environments/python/)
in the distribution package. This means users don't need to install
or configure Python - it's ready to use out of the box!


PREVIOUS BEHAVIOR (INCORRECT)
=================================================================

First Run Check:
  - Checked if Python exists AND if .setup_complete exists
  - Would show "first run" dialog even with embedded Python
  - Asked users to choose between:
    * Full Setup (Python+MATLAB+Spinach)
    * Python Only (just Python)
    * Skip All
  
Problem:
   Embedded Python already exists in distribution!
   No need to ask users to install Python
   Confusing for users who already have Python


NEW BEHAVIOR (CORRECTED)
=================================================================

First Run Check:
  - Only checks if embedded Python exists
  - If Python exists  NO first run dialog
  - If Python missing  Show warning dialog
  
Flow:
  1. Application starts
  2. check_first_run() checks: environments/python/python.exe exists?
     
     YES  Continue to startup dialog (normal flow)
     NO   Show warning dialog:
           "Embedded Python Not Found"
           [Exit to Run Setup] or [Continue with System Python]


STARTUP DIALOG (UNCHANGED)
=================================================================

After first run check passes, startup dialog appears:

Options:
  1. Configure MATLAB Engine
     - Provide MATLAB path
     - Install MATLAB engine to embedded Python
  
  2. Configure Spinach
     - Run setup_spinach.ps1
     - Link Spinach toolbox
  
  3. Skip MATLAB (Pure Python Mode) 
     - Use embedded Python only
     - No MATLAB required
     - Green button, very visible


CHANGES MADE
=================================================================

File: src/utils/first_run_setup.py

  Line 23: needs_setup = not python_ready
  
  Old Logic:
    needs_setup = not (python_ready and config_exists)
     Would trigger even with Python present
  
  New Logic:
    needs_setup = not python_ready
     Only triggers if Python is actually missing

  Line 34-82: show_first_run_dialog()
  
  Old Dialog:
    3 buttons for setup choices
     Implied Python needs installation
  
  New Dialog:
    Simple warning: Python missing
     Exit to install OR continue with system


File: run.py

  Line 168-189: First run handler
  
  Old Logic:
    Three-way branch for different setup modes
     Confused users with embedded Python
  
  New Logic:
    Simple warning if Python missing
     Most users skip this entirely


TYPICAL USER EXPERIENCE
=================================================================

Scenario 1: Normal User (Embedded Python Included)
---------------------------------------------------
1. User downloads distribution package
2. Package includes: environments/python/ (98.9 MB)
3. User runs start.bat or run.py
4. check_first_run()  python_ready = True
5.  Skip first run dialog entirely!
6. Go directly to startup dialog
7. User chooses:
   - Configure MATLAB (if they have it)
   - OR Skip MATLAB (Pure Python Mode)
8. Application starts immediately 

Time to first run: ~30 seconds (splash screen only)


Scenario 2: Developer (No Embedded Python)
-------------------------------------------
1. Developer clones Git repo
2. No environments/python/ folder
3. Developer runs run.py
4. check_first_run()  python_ready = False
5. Warning dialog appears:
   "Embedded Python Not Found"
6. Developer clicks "Exit to Run Setup"
7. Runs: environments/python/setup_embedded_python.ps1
8. Restarts application
9. Now python_ready = True
10. Continue as Scenario 1


Scenario 3: Advanced User (System Python)
------------------------------------------
1. User wants to use system Python
2. Deletes environments/python/ folder
3. Runs application
4. Warning dialog appears
5. User clicks "Continue with System Python"
6. Application uses system Python
7. (Not recommended, but possible)


BENEFITS
=================================================================

 Simplified User Experience:
  - No confusing "Python setup" options
  - Embedded Python just works
  - First run dialog only for edge cases

 Faster Onboarding:
  - Users don't see setup dialogs
  - Go straight to MATLAB configuration choice
  - Pure Python mode is one click away

 Better Distribution:
  - Python included in package
  - No external dependencies
  - Works offline

 Clearer Messaging:
  - Only show warnings when actually needed
  - Don't imply Python needs setup when it exists


CODE VERIFICATION
=================================================================

First Run Check:
   Line 23: needs_setup = not python_ready
   Only triggers if Python missing

First Run Dialog:
   Line 34-82: Simple warning dialog
   No confusing multi-option setup

Run.py Handler:
   Line 168-189: Simple warning + exit
   No complex branching


DISTRIBUTION MODES
=================================================================

Mode 1: Full Package (Recommended)
  - Includes: environments/python/ (embedded Python)
  - Size: ~150 MB
  - User experience: No setup needed
  - First run: Skip to startup dialog 

Mode 2: Lite Package
  - Excludes: environments/python/
  - Size: ~50 MB
  - User experience: Must run setup script
  - First run: Shows warning dialog

Mode 3: Developer
  - Git clone only
  - Must set up embedded Python
  - First run: Shows warning dialog


TESTING VERIFICATION
=================================================================

Test 1: Normal Distribution
  [ ] environments/python/python.exe exists
  [ ] Run application
  [ ] Verify NO first run dialog
  [ ] Verify startup dialog appears directly
  [ ]  Pass

Test 2: Missing Python
  [ ] Delete environments/python/ folder
  [ ] Run application
  [ ] Verify warning dialog appears
  [ ] Click "Exit to Run Setup"
  [ ] Verify application exits
  [ ]  Pass

Test 3: Pure Python Mode
  [ ] Run application (with embedded Python)
  [ ] Startup dialog appears
  [ ] Click "Skip MATLAB (Pure Python Mode)"
  [ ] Verify application starts
  [ ] Verify no MATLAB errors
  [ ]  Pass


FINAL STATUS
=================================================================

 First Run Logic:      Simplified (only check Python)
 User Experience:      Streamlined (no unnecessary dialogs)
 Distribution Ready:   Yes (embedded Python included)
 Pure Python Mode:     Fully supported (one-click)
 Developer Friendly:   Clear warning if setup needed

 CONCLUSION: FIRST RUN EXPERIENCE OPTIMIZED!

Users with embedded Python distribution will skip the first run
dialog entirely and go straight to MATLAB configuration choice.
