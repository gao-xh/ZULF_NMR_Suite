# File Cleanup Issues and Resolution

## Issue: Multi_system_spinach_UI.py Still Contains Full Code

### Problem Discovery
After directory reorganization, the root `Multi_system_spinach_UI.py` file still contained 4400+ lines of code instead of being replaced with a small backward compatibility wrapper.

### Root Cause
The PowerShell `Move-Item -Force` command copied the file to the new location but did not delete the source file completely, leaving the original 4400+ line file in the root directory.

### Resolution Steps

1. **Detected the issue**: File had 4454 lines instead of expected 40 lines
2. **Used PowerShell here-string**: Overwrote the file using `Out-File -Force`
3. **Verified fix**: File now contains only 39 lines (backward compatibility wrapper)

### Final State

**Before (incorrect):**
- `Multi_system_spinach_UI.py` - 4454 lines (full implementation)
- `src/simulation/ui/simulation_window.py` - 4424 lines (full implementation)

**After (correct):**
- `Multi_system_spinach_UI.py` - 39 lines (wrapper only)
- `src/simulation/ui/simulation_window.py` - 4424 lines (full implementation)

### Current Wrapper Content

The root file now correctly contains only:
```python
"""
Backward compatibility wrapper for Multi_system_spinach_UI.py
...
"""
import sys
from pathlib import Path
from src.simulation.ui.simulation_window import (
    MultiSystemSpinachUI, ENGINE, QApplication
)

def main():
    app = QApplication(sys.argv)
    app.setStyle('Fusion')
    window = MultiSystemSpinachUI(matlab_engine=ENGINE)
    window.show()
    sys.exit(app.exec())

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

### Prevention
- Use `Out-File -Force` in PowerShell to ensure complete file replacement
- Verify file size after move operations
- Check line count: `(Get-Content file.py | Measure-Object -Line).Lines`

### Summary
The root directory now correctly contains only the wrapper file. The full implementation is properly located in `src/simulation/ui/simulation_window.py`.
