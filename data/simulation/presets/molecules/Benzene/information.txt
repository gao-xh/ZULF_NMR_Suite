	abstract = {We report the acquisition and interpretation of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) J-spectra at zero magnetic ﬁeld for a series of benzene derivatives, demonstrating the analytical capabilities of zero-ﬁeld NMR. The zeroth-order spectral patterns do not overlap, which allows for straightforward determination of the spin interactions of substituent functional groups. Higher-order eﬀects cause additional line splittings, revealing additional molecular information. We demonstrate resonance linewidths as narrow as 11 mHz, permitting resolution of minute frequency diﬀerences and precise determination of long-range J-couplings. The measurement of J-couplings with the high precision oﬀered by zero-ﬁeld NMR may allow further reﬁnements in the determination of molecular structure and conformation.},
