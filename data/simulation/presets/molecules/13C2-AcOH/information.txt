	abstract = {We present single- and multiple-quantum correlation J-spectroscopy detected in zero ({\textless} 1 lG) magnetic ﬁeld using a 87Rb vapor-cell magnetometer. At zero ﬁeld the spectrum of ethanol appears as a mixture of 13C isotopomers, and correlation spectroscopy is useful in separating the two composite spectra. We also identify and observe the zero-ﬁeld equivalent of a double-quantum transition in 13C2-acetic acid, and show that such transitions are of use in spectral assignment. Two-dimensional spectroscopy further improves the high resolution attained in zero-ﬁeld NMR since selection rules on the coherencetransfer pathways allow for the separation of otherwise overlapping resonances into distinct cross-peaks.
