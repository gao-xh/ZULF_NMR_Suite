  0.00s - START: Initialization started
  0.00s - IMPORT: Importing spinach_bridge modules
  1.25s - ENGINE_START: Starting MATLAB engine
 12.11s - ENGINE_READY: MATLAB engine ready
 12.11s - SYS_CREATE: Creating system object
 12.11s - SYS_ISOTOPES: Setting isotopes ['1H', '1H']
 12.12s - SYS_MAGNET: Setting magnet field 14.1T
 12.12s - BAS_CREATE: Creating basis object
 12.12s - BAS_FORMALISM: Setting formalism 'sphten-liouv'

 12.12s - INTER_CREATE: Creating interactions object
 12.12s - INTER_ZEEMAN: Setting Zeeman interactions
 12.15s - INTER_COUPLING: Setting J-coupling matrix
 13.47s - SIM_CREATE_START: Creating SIM object
 13.47s - SIM_CREATE_CALL: Calling sim.create() [this will take time]
